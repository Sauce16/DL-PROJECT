# DL-PROJECT
Predictive Maintenance for Turbofan Aircraft Engines Using LSTM
Steps for Execution
Follow these steps to execute the Predictive Maintenance model using LSTM for turbofan aircraft engines:

1. Open the Colab Notebook
Open the DL_LSTM_Project.ipynb notebook in Google Colab.

3. Upload Datasets to Colab
Upload the three text files (PM_train.txt, PM_test.txt, PM_truth.txt) to the Colab environment.

5. Run the Notebook Cells
Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to load the datasets, preprocess the data, and train the LSTM model.

7. Evaluate the Model
Use the notebook to evaluate the model's performance on the provided datasets.
